Deploy and Launch the FlightTracker3DApp

------------------------------------------------------------------

1)
Deploying FlightTracker3DApp on Raspberry Pi:

Build the Application in RELASE mode.

Select FlightTracker3DApp as startup project.

IMPORTANT ! !
In Solution Explorer select the FlightTracker3DApp project 

Build --> Publish --> Folder:
	Target folder: ..\publishCommon\

	Profile settings 
		Deployment mode: Self contained
		Runtime: linux-arm64



Build --> Publish --> Click "Publish" button


Here you find concise steps to enable passwordless SSH from your Windows machine to the Raspberry Pi (recommended: use ed25519 keys):
	raspberry_pi_best_practice_start_guide.txt

Copy to Raspberry Pi:

/*  C:\Users\niels\source\repos\FlightTracker3D\publishCommon   */


Open a powershell

Navigate to the folder where the application is built.
C:\Users\niels\source\repos\FlightTracker3D

Open a terminal and connect to the Raspberry Pi via SSH:
ssh pi@raspberrypi

Create a folder for the application:
mkdir FlightTracker3D

From windows PC:
scp -r publishCommon\* pi@raspberrypi:~/FlightTracker3D

Of unknown reason, the .json file is not copied with the above command. So copy it separately:
scp -r .\publishCommon\FlightTracker3DAppSettings.json pi@raspberrypi:~/FlightTracker3D

From Raspberry Pi:

sudo raspi-config
Enable: Interface Options --> I2C --> Yes

reboot

cd FlightTracker3D/
chmod +x ./FlightTracker3DApp

------------------------------------------------------------------

2) 
Setup the Application Settings: 
cd FlightTracker3D/
nano ./FlightTracker3DAppSettings.json
-->
{
  "FlightTracker3DAppSettings": {
    "MinimumLogLevel": "Warning",
    "HardwareModes": {
      "LcdHardwareMode": "Emulated",
      "LedHardwareMode": "Emulated",
      "StepperMotorHardwareMode": "Emulated"
    }
  }
}

------------------------------------------------------------------

3)
PENDING LAUNCH READRD
cd readsb

// For testing purposes, we can launch readsb with the following command. This will write the received data to a json file every 10 seconds and also make it available via the network on port 30003. The json file is needed for the FlightTracker3DApp to display the received data. In production, you would typically run readsb as a service and configure it to start automatically on boot.
./readsb --device-type rtlsdr --gain auto --interactive  --write-json-every=10 --json-location-accuracy=0 --write-json /home/pi/readsb-json --net --net-sbs-port=30003

// Use this command. JSon file is not needed for the FlightTracker3DApp to display the received data. The FlightTracker3DApp will connect to port 30003 to receive the data. In production, you would typically run readsb as a service and configure it to start automatically on boot.

./readsb --device-type rtlsdr --gain auto --interactive  --net --net-sbs-port=30003


------------------------------------------------------------------

4)
Launching the Application:

Open a terminal and connect to the Raspberry Pi via SSH:
ssh pi@raspberrypi

From Raspberry Pi:
cd FlightTracker3D/
./FlightTracker3DApp

------------------------------------------------------------------

5)
Check the source code status in GITHUB
https://github.com/NielsKaaaeOlsen/FlightTracker3D


6)
// If you want to deploy the application again, you can use the following command to build and publish the application in one step. This will create a self-contained application for linux-arm64 and output it to the publishCommon folder. You can then copy the contents of this folder to the Raspberry Pi as described in step 1.
dotnet publish FlightTracker3DApp/FlightTracker3DApp.csproj -c Release -r linux-arm64 --self-contained true -o publishCommon
